WDK for Windows 10, version 1903 worked well for Windows 10 version 1909. To check the version, Start -> Settings -> Update & Security -> View update history.

Download the WDK from, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk. I had used https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085767.

Install the WDK. Search for devcon.exe. Mostly this should be located under "C:\ProgramFiles\Windows Kits\10\Tools\{x64/x86}". x64 worked for me.

Copy devcon to the location where the batch file is present. Call the devcon as "%~dp0devcon.exe" OR the absolute path of the exe.

To identify the device,
1. 'devcon hwids *' to get all the driver information. Search through this list to identify the device ID.
2. 'devcon resources "DEVICE_ID_FROM_ABOVE_STEP" '. If this step produced unique output, "DEVICE_ID_FROM_ABOVE_STEP" can be used as the device ID.
3. 'devcon disable "DEVICE_ID_FROM_ABOVE_STEP" ' to disable the device.
4. 'devcon enable "DEVICE_ID_FROM_ABOVE_STEP" ' to enable the device.
5. 'devcon restart "DEVICE_ID_FROM_ABOVE_STEP" ' to restart device.
